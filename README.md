# Ionic MTG

I don't know what I want to do in this project yet, for now is just a test with the MTG API:

    1. npm install -g ionic cordova
    2. Clone the repository
    3. Enter on the project and run npm install
    4. After the install, just run ionic serve
    5. The project will build and watch in the localhost:8100


# Build and deploy

    1. run npm install
    2. After the install, just run **ionic serve**
    3. The project will build and watch in the **localhost:8100**
    4. To deploy to device make sure that you already have the Android SDK installed on your computer
    5. Plug an Android device to your computer
    6. Run: **ionic cordova run android**
    7. To build a production app use the flag --prod (even in ionic serve)   

That will build the app in the browser in the first 3 steps and deploy the app to an android device in the others.
